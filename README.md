## 🔬 Project Overview
Water crises and pollution in Egypt are pressing challenges caused by urbanization, poor waste management, and agricultural runoff.  

This project introduces a **sustainable wastewater recycling system** that uses a combination of **adsorption, electrolysis, and chemical precipitation** to significantly reduce pollutants like TDS, salinity, and turbidity.  

The system is **low-cost, energy-efficient, and scalable** — making it ideal for rural and industrial use.

## ✨ Features
- 🌊 **Stage 1 – Adsorption:** Gravel, sand, and activated carbon layers for initial pollutant removal  
- ⚡ **Stage 2 – Electrolysis:** Graphite rods + NaCl to break down pollutants and reduce TDS  
- 🧪 **Stage 3 – Chemical Precipitation:** HCl, NaOH, and alum to bind and remove impurities  
- 📟 **Electronics & Control:**  
  - MQ sensors to measure turbidity & salinity  
  - LCD for real-time display  
  - Relay + Arduino UNO for system automation  
- 🏭 **Scalability:** Portable prototype design → expandable to industrial & rural setups
